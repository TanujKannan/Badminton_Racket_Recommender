# Badminton_Racket_Recommender
This is a simple racket recommender, that uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict the right racket for you, based on your inputs. 

The dataset is artificially synthesized as proof of concept. I did not find any feasible sources of data for this project.

Streamlit is used as the UI for the app. 

To view this, copy and paste the three files into your IDE of choice, ensure the files are in the same folder, and then type $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py, in your terminal to view the final product.
